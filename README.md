# Simple iPhone Swift Notepad App

**pH Simple NotePad** is a very basic iPhone Swift notepad app (*similar to the official Apple Notes app*) with a clear and understandable Swift code (ideal for beginners).

Like my [Desktop Java Text Editor](https://github.com/pH-7/Simple-Java-Text-Editor), this [Swift](https://swift.org) iPhone app is easy to understand for beginners and contains several useful comments. Feel free to edit, add features and create PRs :smiley:
