# Simple iPhone Swift Notepad App

**pH Simple NotePad** is a very basic and clear Swift notepad app for iPhone, iOS 8/9 and so on.

Like my [Desktop Java Text Editor](https://github.com/pH-7/Simple-Java-Text-Editor), this [Swift](https://swift.org) iPhone app is easy to understand for beginners and contains several useful comments.
